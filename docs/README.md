# BMasterAI Playbook Library

*Looking for the full technical reference? See [`README.content.md`](README.content.md) in this folder.*

Think of `docs/` as your internal marketing desk: every guide turns an agent into a repeatable launch. Instead of dense reference manuals, you will find campaign-ready briefs, walkthroughs, and instrumentation tips that help product, marketing, and sales teams rally around each new build.

## Library Highlights
- **Launch Guides** – `getting-started.md` and `kubernetes-deployment.md` walk stakeholders from demo to production narrative.
- **Story Studio** – Under `examples/`, drill into positioning notes, demo flows, and CTA ideas for each featured agent.
- **Telemetry Narratives** – `examples/advanced.md` and monitoring guides explain how to turn reasoning traces into dashboard-ready proof points.

## How to Use This Folder
1. **Set the Hook** – Use the Getting Started brief to align on audience, promise, and desired wow moment.
2. **Build the Journey** – Pull lesson content or example scripts into a tailored workshop or webinar agenda.
3. **Arm the Team** – Copy launch checklists, asset lists, and KPI templates into your project tracker.
4. **Measure & Iterate** – Feed telemetry wins back into the docs so every future agent has a tighter story.

## Suggested Reading Order
- New teammates → `getting-started.md`, then `examples/basic.md`
- Campaign owners → `examples/advanced.md`, `monitoring/metrics.md`, and `advanced/performance.md`
- Operators → `kubernetes-deployment.md`, `monitoring/logging.md`, and `advanced/security.md`
