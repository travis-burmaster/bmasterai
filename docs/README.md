# BMasterAI Playbook Library

*Looking for the full technical reference? See [`README.content.md`](README.content.md) in this folder.*

Think of `docs/` as your agent enablement shelf: every guide breaks down how and why an example works so you can teach it to someone else. Instead of dense reference manuals, you will find walkthroughs, debriefs, and instrumentation tips that help product and engineering teams internalize successful patterns.

## Library Highlights
- **Launch Guides** – `getting-started.md` and `kubernetes-deployment.md` walk stakeholders from demo to production narrative.
- **Story Studio** – Under `examples/`, dig into talking points, decision logs, and facilitation notes for each featured agent.
- **Telemetry Narratives** – `examples/advanced.md` and monitoring guides explain how to turn reasoning traces into actionable lessons.

## How to Use This Folder
1. **Set the Hook** – Use the Getting Started brief to align on learner goals and the aha moment you want to deliver.
2. **Build the Journey** – Pull lesson content or example scripts into a workshop, brown-bag, or self-paced module.
3. **Arm the Team** – Copy checklists, asset lists, and KPI templates into your project tracker so every run stays consistent.
4. **Measure & Iterate** – Capture telemetry insights and retrospective notes so the next cohort benefits from what you discovered.

## Suggested Reading Order
- New teammates → `getting-started.md`, then `examples/basic.md`
- Program leads → `examples/advanced.md`, `monitoring/metrics.md`, and `advanced/performance.md`
- Operators → `kubernetes-deployment.md`, `monitoring/logging.md`, and `advanced/security.md`
