## How to Activate a Playbook
1. **Clone the repo** and install dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]`).
2. **Open the example** folder, read the README or inline notes, and note the hero outcome you want to showcase.
3. **Customize the narrative** – tweak prompts, copy, or UI labels so the story resonates with your audience.
4. **Record or stream** – use Loom, Streamlit sharing, or live demos to capture the experience.
5. **Share the assets** – drop screenshots, scripts, and recap notes into the repository so others can replicate the magic.

## Contribute a New Playbook
Create a folder named after the outcome (e.g., `ai-patient-intake-navigator/`). Include:
- `README.md` describing the audience, promise, and success metrics
- Demo scripts or notebooks
- Suggested social copy or launch blurb

Then open a PR highlighting how the playbook fuels adoption or revenue, plus any telemetry dashboards that prove the impact.
